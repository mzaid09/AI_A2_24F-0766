## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a **Dynamic Pathfinding Agent** capable of navigating a grid-based environment using **Informed Search Algorithms**. The agent finds the optimal path from a **Start node (S)** to a **Goal node (G)** while avoiding obstacles (walls).

The most advanced feature is **Dynamic Mode** — where new obstacles randomly appear while the agent is already moving, forcing it to **detect the blockage and re-plan a new path in real time**.

---

## ✨ Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Dynamic Grid Sizing** | Grid is 25×25 by default (easily configurable) |
| **Random Maze Generation** | Auto-generates maze with 30% obstacle density |
| **Interactive Map Editor** | Click on any cell to add or remove walls manually |
| **A* Search** | Finds the optimal (shortest) path |
| **Greedy Best-First Search** | Finds a fast path (not always optimal) |
| **Manhattan Heuristic** | Best for 4-directional grid movement |
| **Euclidean Heuristic** | Straight-line distance estimate |
| **Dynamic Obstacles** | New walls spawn randomly while agent moves |
| **Auto Re-planning** | Agent detects blockage and re-plans instantly |
| **Live Metrics Dashboard** | Shows nodes visited, path cost, time, re-plans |
| **Full GUI Visualization** | Color-coded cells showing every step of search |
| **Keyboard Shortcuts** | Quick controls for fast testing |

## 🧠 Algorithms Implemented

### 1. A\* Search
```
f(n) = g(n) + h(n)

g(n) = actual cost from Start to current node
h(n) = estimated cost from current node to Goal
f(n) = total estimated cost of path through node n
```

**Properties:**
- ✅ Complete — always finds a solution if one exists
- ✅ Optimal — always finds the SHORTEST path
- ✅ Uses both actual cost and heuristic estimate
- ⚠️ Explores more nodes than Greedy BFS

---

### 2. Greedy Best-First Search
```
f(n) = h(n) only

h(n) = estimated cost from current node to Goal
```

**Properties:**
- ✅ Fast — explores fewer nodes
- ✅ Uses visited list to avoid loops
- ❌ Not optimal — may find longer path
- ❌ Only considers heuristic, ignores actual cost

---

## 📐 Heuristic Functions

### Manhattan Distance
```
h(n) = |row1 - row2| + |col1 - col2|
```
- Best for grids with 4-directional movement
- Like counting city blocks 🏙️
- Admissible — never overestimates

### Euclidean Distance
```
h(n) = √( (row1-row2)² + (col1-col2)² )
```
- Straight line distance between two points
- Like a bird flying directly to destination 🐦
- Admissible — never overestimates

### Button Functions

| Button | Function |
|---|---|
| **Generate Maze** | Randomly fills grid with 30% walls |
| **Run Search** | Runs selected algorithm and animates agent |
| **Clear Path** | Removes visited/path colors, keeps walls |
| **Reset Grid** | Completely clears the entire grid |

## 🎨 Color Legend

| Color | Cell Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 🟢 Green | Start (S) | Where agent begins |
| 🔴 Pink/Red | Goal (G) | Where agent must reach |
| ⬛ Dark Blue | Empty | Agent can walk here |
| ⬜ Dark Gray | Wall | Blocked, cannot pass |
| 🟡 Yellow | Frontier | Currently in priority queue |
| 🔵 Blue | Visited | Already explored |
| 🟠 Orange | Final Path | The best route found |
| 🟣 Purple | Agent (@) | Current agent position |
| 🔴 Bright Red | Dynamic Obstacle | Newly spawned wall |

---

## 📊 Live Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| **Nodes Visited** | Total cells expanded by algorithm |
| **Path Cost** | Number of steps in final path |
| **Exec Time** | Time taken to compute solution (ms) |
| **Re-plans** | How many times agent re-planned |

---

## ⚡ Dynamic Mode

When **Dynamic Mode** is ON:
```
1. Agent starts moving along planned path
2. Every step → 8% chance of new obstacle spawning
3. If obstacle appears ON the path:
      → Agent detects blockage immediately
      → Calls A* again from current position
      → New path calculated instantly
      → Agent continues on new route
      → Re-plan counter increases by 1
4. If obstacle NOT on path:
      → Agent ignores it and continues
```

## 🆚 Algorithm Comparison

| Property | A\* Search | Greedy BFS |
|---|---|---|
| **Formula** | f = g + h | f = h only |
| **Optimal?** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Complete?** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Speed** | Slower | Faster |
| **Nodes Expanded** | More | Less |
| **Best For** | Optimal path | Fast path |

## 💡 Concepts Explained

### What is g(n)?
> The **actual cost** from Start node to current node. Increases by 1 for each step taken.

### What is h(n)?
> The **heuristic estimate** of cost from current node to Goal. An educated guess — not exact.

### What is f(n)?
> **f(n) = g(n) + h(n)** — Total estimated cost of cheapest path through node n.

### What is a Priority Queue?
> A data structure that always returns element with **lowest value first**. Used by both algorithms to always explore most promising node next.

### What is Backtracking?
> After Goal is found, trace back from Goal to Start using **parent dictionary**. Each node remembers who discovered it. This gives us the final orange path.

### What is Re-planning?
> When new obstacle blocks current path, agent runs A\* again from its **current position** to find new route to Goal.

### What is Admissible Heuristic?
> A heuristic that **never overestimates** the true cost. Both Manhattan and Euclidean are admissible. This guarantees A\* finds optimal path.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Change these values at top of `pathfinding_agent.py`:
